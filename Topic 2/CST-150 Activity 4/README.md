This program will calculate the time in seconds and convert it to days,Hours, Minutes, and
Seconds. All you have to do is enter in the amount of seconds you want to convert and
click the convert button. After clicking the convert button it will convert the amount of seconds
entered into Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds. If you some how enter in letters instead of numbers
it will give you a invalid data instead of calculating the time.
