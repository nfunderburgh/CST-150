This is an inventory class that allows the user to add, remove, restock items within the array list. Users can use either print product list or print item count to see the items within the array list. This would be helpful to keep track of an inventory of items. One feature that would needed to be added in the feature is a away to keep track of items within stock when shutting down the program.
